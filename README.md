# Excursion-web-page
Platform Project: Excursion web page

In this project, I’ll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.”
I’ll use my growing programing tool-set including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. 
when it all comes together, the web page I’ll build will advertises a mobile app which helps users record
and share their experiences, so I’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene.
